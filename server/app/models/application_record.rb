  # models and the expectations of the client (or to be more exact:
  # The corresponding JSON-schema specification).

  # * The "created_at" and "updated_at" fields must be strings
  # * "Empty" values should possibly be omitted
  #

  # a deriving class will probably want to use "slice" to narrow down the
  # set of attributes.

  #
  # @return [Hash] All attributes of this model as the client expects it.

  # Okay, this is tricky: We somehow need to keep the compiled version
  # of the syntaxtree in sync with the "actual" syntaxtree. So we want
  # to have some action that checks whether the syntaxtree has been
  # updated and then update the compiled version.
  #
  # The main problem is that the compilation requires interaction with
  # an external process. This is a) slow and b) error prone. So my
  # gut says that its probably good to be explicit about this (possibly)
  # fragile operation. And this leads to the actual question: Where
  # should the "sync" code go?
  #
  # And on top of that this dependency makes testing quite hard. After
  # all there are possibly quite a few code resources that will be saved
  # during testing, even if we don't care about the details of compilation.
  # The IdeService should not come in to play for each and every of this
  # testfiles because a) it slows down tests and b) it makes "real"
  # syntaxtrees a requirement for trees during testing.
  #
  # The following options have been considered:
  #
  # Option 1) In the model, immediatly after setting the ast. This was
  # proposed on SO (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48623312/) but
  # I don't really fancy the idea of running the compiler on every
  # assignment and making a "simple" assignment possibly raising
  # exceptions.
  #
  # Option 2) In the model, but only on save operations using a callback.
  # This still means the code resource has a *huge* dependency on an
  # external process, but at least its encapsulated when touching the
  # other *huge* dependency (the database).
  #
  # Option 3) In every controller that somehow touches this model. This
  # seems to go against the core idea of "fat models and skinny controllers",
  # so I will leave that out for the moment.

 Core Concepts
***************

Conventional development environments are programs that are tailored to suit the needs of professionals. Due to their complexity they do not lend themselves well to introduce pupils to programming. BlattWerkzeug is a tool that is geared towards "serious learners" and is intended to be used with support from teachers or some similar form of supervision.

To eliminate the possibility of syntactical errors while programming, the elements of the programming- or markup-languages are represented by graphical blocks, similar to the approach taken by the software `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/>`_. These blocks can be combined by using drag & drop operations.

Block Languages
===============

BlattWerkzeug comes with a variety of different languages enabled, but currently focusses on web development and databases.

Projects
========

All work in BlattWerkzeug is done in the scope of so called "projects". Projects are the main category of work and have at least a name and a user friendly description. Apart from that they bundle together various resources and assets such as databases, images and code.

Code Resources
--------------

At the very core, there are three different structures involved when a code resource is edited with a block editor:

* The abstract syntax tree represents the structure of the code that is edited.
* The selected programming language controls how the syntaxtree is validated and compiled.
* The selected language model controls how blocks used in a syntaxtree are layouted and which blocks are available in the sidebar.

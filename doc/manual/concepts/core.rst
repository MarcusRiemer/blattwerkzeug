Core Concepts
=========================================

BlattWerkzeug aims to be a IDE that is friendly to that are new to the whole concept of programming.

Projects
-----------------------------------------

All work in BlattWerkzeug is done in the scope of so called "projects". Projects are the main category of work and have at least a name and a user friendly description. 

Code Resources
-----------------------------------------

At the very core, there are three different structures involved when a code resource is edited with a block editor:

* The abstract syntax tree represents the structure of the code that is edited.
* The selected programming language controls how the syntaxtree is validated and compiled.
* The selected language model controls how blocks used in a syntaxtree are layouted and which blocks are available in the sidebar.

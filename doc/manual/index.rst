BlattWerkzeug Manual
====================

This guide is mainly technical documentation for developers, system administrators or advanced users that want to develop their own language flavors inside BlattWerkzeug. It is *not* a guide for pupils or other end users that want to know how to program *using* BlattWerkzeug.

Contrary to "normal" compilers, BlattWerkzeug only operates on abstract syntax trees. Every code resource (``SQL``, ``HTML``, a regular expression, ...) that exists within BlattWerkzeug is, at its core, simply a syntaxtree. All operations that are described in this manual work with the syntaxtrees of these code resources in one way or another.

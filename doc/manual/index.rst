BlattWerkzeug Manual
=========================================

This guide is mainly technical documentation for developers, system administrators or advanced users that want to develop their own language flavors inside BlattWerkzeug. It is *not* a guide for pupils or other end users that want to know how to program *using* BlattWerkzeug.

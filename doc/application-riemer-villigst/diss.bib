	abstract = {Type systems allow programmers to communicate a partial specification of their program to the compiler using types, which can then be used to check that the implementation matches the specification. But can the types be used to aid programmers during development? In this experience report I describe the design and implementation of my lightweight and practical extension to the typed-holes of GHC that improves user experience by adding a list of valid hole fits and refinement hole fits to the error message of typed-holes. By leveraging the type checker, these fits are selected from identifiers in scope such that if the hole is substituted with a valid hole fit, the resulting expression is guaranteed to type check.},

Just as the LEGO MindStorms robotics kit added programmability to an activity deeply rooted in youth culture (building with LEGO bricks), Scratch adds programmability to the media-rich and network-based activities that are most popular among youth at afterschool computer centers. Taking advantage of the extraordinary processing power of current computers, Scratch supports new programming paradigms and activities that were previously infeasible, making it better positioned to succeed than previous attempts to introduce programming to youth.},
